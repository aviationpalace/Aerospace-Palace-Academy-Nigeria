# Aerospace Palace Academy, Nigeria
Aerospace Palace International, Nigeria is where Innovation happens. The mobile App and the rocket and aircraft kits serve as the “vehicle” to reinforce Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics concepts as well as to teach valuable life skills such as teamwork, leadership, and innovative thinking.

The training arm (Aerospace Palace Academy, Nigeria) was created in order to foster excellence in research and innovation on the principles of transparency, objectivity, equality, and openness. Our guiding principle is community cooperation to create better research, provide fair recognition of excellence and transform best ideas into commercial value proposition. Also to create an environment that rewards excellence transparently, and builds recognition objectively regardless of age, economic status or country of origin, where no membership fees or closed door committees stand in the way of your research career. Through these shared values, we lead the way toward advancing the world of research and innovation, empowering individuals and institutions for the good of society to fully benefit from the digital revolution.

Our mission is to stimulate a lasting interest in the STEM disciplines, with the goal of encouraging students to pursue careers in these fields.  This is accomplished by actively involving students in the support of authentic research currently being conducted on the International Space Station (ISS) or in a NASA ground-based laboratory. This will inspire young generation in developing nations and underserved group in developed nations around the world to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM); for the future will be built on people’s capacity to innovate, invent, and solve problems creatively.

Through collaboration with NASA and NASA sponsored researchers, we create an educational mini-curriculum for the high school or middle school classroom that engages students as research assistants, providing data for the Principal Investigator, (PI)' This includes an American Institute of Aeronautics & Astronautics (USA) and Space Foundation (USA) approved curriculum covering over 92 lessons and subdivided into 13 course-packs for easy accessibility. At the end of the pack, we have 10 selected multiple choice questions with 2 each from the 5 topics. Currently, we have a collaborative relationship with several NASA or NASA supported researchers.  The program is delivered and managed via our website; each teacher being assigned a password protected page for management and program delivery.

During our mission students briefly learn about the scientist and their research, participate in classroom experiments or activity that mirrors the research experiment on the ISS, and then do some type of an analysis and data gathering activity.   These hands-on inquiry-based activities are supported by near-real time digital and video images downlinked from orbit and provided to the classroom via our website. Also provided are real time images of a control ground experiment being conducted by BioServe Space Technologies, a NASA Research Partnership at the University of Colorado or elsewhere.

Student research supports the work of the PI, while meeting the educational goals of the classroom and final student data is provided to the PI for review and, if appropriate, inclusion into research databanks.

Our missions typically require between three and seven classroom periods and could involve:
1.   Introduction of NASA and its mission
2.   Introduction of PI and research focus
3.   Instruction on download and use of any required software
4.   Conducting the research (the heart of the mission) which may include:
(i)	Hypothesis development
(ii)	Classroom lab activity mirroring the actual research 
(iii)	Observation and photo/video analysis
(iv)	Data recording and submission
(v)	Formulate conclusions 
(vi)	Evaluation
